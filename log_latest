 [DEBUG] setTranscript: Good morning, Mrs Rao. How have you been feeling lately? Good morning, doctor.

I've been feeling very tired for the past 2 weeks.

I get short of breath when I walk even short distances and I've noticed occasional dizziness I see.

Have you had any favour chest pain or palpitations?

No fever, but sometimes my heart feels like it's racing, especially at night.

Have you noticed any changes in your skin like penis or yellowing?

My family says I look taller than usual.

Understood, let's check your vital signs and do a quick physical exam. Your blood pressure is 110 / 70, pulse is 98.

I can hear a slight murmur in your heart and your conjunctive. I look pale. We should run a complete blood count to check for an email. Is it serious? The symptoms suggest iron deficiency anemia but will confirm with blood test. It's usually treatable with diet. Changes in medication. What medication will I need?

I am prescribing ferrous sulphate 325 milligrams to be taken once daily after meals for 3 months.

Also take vitamin C 500 milligrams with it to improve iron absorption. Avoid tear coffee within an hour of taking the table.
